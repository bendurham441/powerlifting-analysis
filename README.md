# Exploratory Data Analysis With Python

Skills used:

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib

## What is this repository?

In this repository, I explore the [OpenPowerlifting dataset](https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/bulk-csv-docs.html) to practice my data science skills.

## How to run these files

I uploaded these files with the output of the ipython notebooks, but if you would like to run these notebooks yourself, you can download the datasets from [here](https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/bulk-csv-docs.html). The dataset is too large to include in this repository.
